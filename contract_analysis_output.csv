12.01 Term. Unless sooner terminated in accordance with this Article, this Agreement will continue in full force beginning on the Effective Date and ending two (2) years thereafter (“Term”).
12.02 Early Termination. The Parties recognize that circumstances may arise where this Agreement’s early termination would be desirable. Accordingly, either Party may terminate this Agreement or all/part of a Project for any reason and at any time upon giving the other Party sixty (60) days prior written notice. In the event of early termination of a Project or this Agreement. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated by ExxonMobil, ExxonMobil will pay FCE reasonable non-refundable expenses incurred by FCE in satisfying authorized commitments entered into by FCE with third parties prior to receipt of the termination notice. FCE will uses its best efforts to minimize termination expenses and will give appropriate credit to ExxonMobil where applicable. The total amount paid FCE under this Agreement or for a Project, including all amounts paid following termination, will not exceed the maximum authorized charge specified in this Agreement or for a Project.
12.03 Failure to Perform. If ExxonMobil fails to fulfill a material monetary obligation or FCE fails to execute material tasks or obligations in material compliance with all criteria set forth in a respective mutually agreed upon Project Description, in the time and manner required herein, provided that in the case of FCE’s tasks or obligations any non-compliance or delay in meeting said criteria is not due to ExxonMobil or force majeure pursuant to Paragraph 15.01 (Force Majeure), the non-defaulting Party may give written notice of intent to terminate this Agreement, specifying the details of such default. Unless the defaulting Party has remedied such default within the Cure Period, this Agreement may be terminated, without penalty, payment or prejudice to claims then accrued, by written notice to the defaulting Party by the non-defaulting Party specifying the date of termination which will be of immediate effect. In the event of termination under this Paragraph 12.03 where FCE is the defaulting Party, FCE’s royalty-free licenses described in Paragraph 7.01(b)(1), 8.02(b)(1)(i), 8.02 (b)(1)(ii), 8.02(b)(1)(iii), and 8.02(b)(2)(i) will immediately convert to royalty-bearing licenses, with the royalty rate to be negotiated by the Parties in good faith.
12.04 Other Termination. ExxonMobil may terminate this Agreement upon fifteen (15) days written notice, without penalty, payment or prejudice to claims and obligations then accrued, if FCE undergoes a Change in Control. Subject to requirements of applicable law, FCE will provide notice to ExxonMobil prior to, or promptly after, it becomes aware of any such Change in Control, and if prior notice is prohibited by applicable Law, as soon as practicable or after such notice is no longer prohibited, but in no event later than one (1) business day after any public announcement with respect to any such asset transfer or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, in the event of termination under this Paragraph 12.04 ExxonMobil may terminate any licenses granted to FCE under this Agreement that would otherwise survive termination, taking into account the circumstances surrounding the Change in Control. Any licenses granted to ExxonMobil under this Agreement that would otherwise survive termination will continue to survive termination.
12.05 Bankruptcy.
(A) To the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines that this Agreement is subject to assumption or rejection under Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) or the applicable law of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding in a non-U.S. jurisdiction:
(i) All rights and licenses granted to ExxonMobil and its Affiliates under or pursuant to this Agreement are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, for all purposes of Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to “intellectual property” as defined in section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(ii) If a case is commenced under the Bankruptcy Code by or against FCE and this Agreement is rejected as provided in the Bankruptcy Code, and ExxonMobil or any of its Affiliates elects to retain its rights hereunder as provided in the Bankruptcy Code, then ExxonMobil and its Affiliates shall retain all rights hereunder in perpetuity without further royalty payments of any kind and FCE (in any capacity, including debtor-in-possession) and its successors and assigns (including, without limitations, a trustee) shall not interfere with such rights.
(iii) In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of FCE in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the rights, powers and remedies of ExxonMobil and its Affiliates shall be applied under any applicable laws which are equivalent to Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, or if there is no such equivalent, the Parties will take all such actions as are permissible under applicable law to permit the continuation of the licenses contained in this Agreement to the maximum extent possible.
(iv) In the event FCE admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they fall due in the general course, becomes or is determined to be insolvent, makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets, or a substantial part thereof, or becomes subject to a proceeding under any statute or act relating to insolvency or the protection of rights of creditors, ExxonMobil receives, at its election, continued access to all Program Information, including the Project materials, equipment, and FCE’s Background Information and Background Patents, and ExxonMobil will have access to relevant lab notebooks, computers containing technical information and know-how, journals, ledgers and manuals containing technical information and know-how in each case relating to the Program Information and FCE's Background Information and Background Patents.
(B) To the maximum extent permitted under law, ExxonMobil may terminate this Agreement upon fifteen (15) days written notice, without penalty, payment or prejudice to claims and obligations then accrued, if FCE commences a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Code or a similar voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, or if an order for relief is entered in an involuntary case filed against FCE under the Bankruptcy Code, and such case is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of the entry of such order, or if FCE makes a voluntary general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or suffers or permits agrees to the entry of an order appointing a receiver in an action actually pending in a court of competent jurisdiction for that portion of its business or assets related to the Project. In the event of termination under this Paragraph 12.05 and subject to ExxonMobil’s waiver (in its sole discretion), any licenses granted to FCE under this Agreement that would otherwise survive termination will automatically terminate and any licenses granted to ExxonMobil under this Agreement that would otherwise survive termination will continue to survive termination.

4.01 Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. FCE will promptly disclose to ExxonMobil, in written or other tangible form, any and all Program Information including any Program Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, FCE agrees to hold Program Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of ExxonMobil, FCE agrees to use and practice Program Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 7 (License to Program Results).
4.02 Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. Each Party will make available its Background Information to the other Party that it believes will be useful in carrying out work under the Program. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, each Party agrees to hold the Background Information it receives from the other Party in confidence, and to not disclose or make available the other Party’s Background Information to any third party without the express prior written consent of the other Party, for a period commencing on the Effective Date and ending twenty (20) years thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of the other Party, each Party agrees to use and practice the other Party’s Background Information only for the Program or as authorized in Article 8 (License to Background Information and Patents).
4.03 Non-Analysis of Background Samples. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, each Party agrees not to determine or have determined the composition or physical structure of any Background Sample received from the other Party, which includes unused, used and spent Background Samples or portions thereof, whether by analyzing, having analyzed, inspection, reverse engineering or otherwise.
4.04 Information Handling Obligations. Each Party will endeavor to mark Confidential Information as follows:
(a) Confidential Information first disclosed in tangible form or electronically will be marked by the Disclosing Party as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import when provided, indicating whether the information is “Program Information” or “Background Information”;
(b) Confidential Information first disclosed orally or by visual display will be identified by the Disclosing Party as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import at first disclosure and subsequently confirmed as confidential in a summary provided in an e-mail or other written communication delivered to the other Party within thirty (30) days after first disclosure, that references the date of the confidential disclosure indicating whether the information is “Program Information” or “Background Information”; and
(c) If a Sample is sent to the other Party, the Sample will be marked by the Disclosing Party as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import at the time of disclosure indicating whether the Sample is “Program Information” or “Background Information”.
The failure to appropriately mark information/materials as “confidential” or “proprietary” upon initial disclosure to the Receiving Party will not be considered a waiver of confidentiality. Information/materials marked as “proprietary” or “confidential” when first disclosed, without further identification of the category of confidential information, will be presumptively considered and treated as Program Information until the Disclosing Party notifies the Receiving Party otherwise in writing.
4.05 Exceptions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and restricted use herein shall not apply to any information or materials to the extent the Receiving Party can establish by documentary evidence that one or more of the following exceptions apply:
a. the information or material was already in the Receiving Party’s or its Affiliate’s lawful possession (free of any confidentiality and use restrictions) and was not previously acquired directly or indirectly from the other Party under a current obligation of confidentiality;
b. the information or material was already in the public domain or subsequently entered the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving Party;
c. the information or material was or is hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, or its Affiliate, on a non-confidential basis by a third party legally entitled to provide the information or material without restriction;
d. the information or material was independently developed by employees or agents of the Receiving Party or its Affiliate who did not have access to relevant information provided by the Disclosing Party; and/or
e. the information or material was released from the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by the Disclosing Party’s written authorization.
The later occurrence of any one of the aforementioned exceptions will not excuse any failure to adequately protect Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement prior to the existence of the exception. More specific Confidential Information will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is publicly available or in the possession of Receiving Party pursuant to one of the exceptions. Also a combination of features will not be deemed within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are publicly available or in Receiving Party’s possession pursuant to one of the exceptions.
4.06 Disclosure to Affiliates, Contractors, and Sub-licensees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Receiving Party may disclose a Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its Affiliates, and said Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to their respective contractors providing services in furtherance of a Project as well as to permitted sub-licensees hereunder, provided such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees have agreed to be bound by confidentiality and limited use obligations no less protective of Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information than the terms contained herein. The Receiving Party will be liable to the Disclosing Party for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information by such Affiliates, contractors, and sub-licensees.
4.07 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that a Receiving Party (or its Affiliate) is required by law, court order or rule, or government authority to disclose the Confidential Information that Receiving Party is obligated to hold in confidence pursuant to Paragraph 4.01 (Program Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction) and/or Paragraph 4.02 (Background Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction), then the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party prior to disclosure in order to enable the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order at the Disclosing Party’s sole expense. In any event, the Receiving Party who is required to disclose such information will request confidential treatment of the information and only disclose the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to comply with such law, court order or rule, or government authority.
4.08 Disclosures in Patent Applications. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, ExxonMobil may disclose the minimum amount of FCE’s Confidential Background Information reasonably necessary to support a Program Patent subject to the review process in Paragraph 6.02 (Solicitation of Program Patents).
4.09 Return/Destruction. At the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party agrees to return to Disclosing Party or, at Disclosing Party’s option, dispose of or destroy, Disclosing Party’s Confidential Background Information and any of Disclosing Party’s unused Background Samples. However, notwithstanding anything else in this Paragraph, the Receiving Party may retain such documents and materials to the extent such documents and materials are identified as necessary for beneficial use of a further Project or a license granted herein and the Receiving Party has notified the Disclosing Party in writing of the need for such documents and materials. Any dispute over whether such documents and materials are necessary shall be escalated to senior management for resolution. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything else in this Paragraph 4.09, the Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such documents and materials in its secure files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this Agreement and the Receiving Party will not be required to purge or cause others to purge electronic archival media automatically generated by backup computer systems if said media will be destroyed pursuant to a systematic records retention process and not otherwise utilized.
